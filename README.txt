Welcome to noSQL database creator!


There are two ways to run and interact with the database. 

1. by running the noSQL.py file
2. by running noSQL.ipynb file
I suggest you to use the jupyter notebook version as I included testacases there. 

1. 

To run the noSQL.py file make sure you have all the libraries included in the code. 

Run the code and interact with it. 


2. 

Open the noSQL.ipynb file in jupyter notebook and interact with it. There are some examples given in the file which demonstrates its power. 

To get more information on how to interact with the database read "Documentation.txt"
